## Overview
As someone who has spent their professional life devoted to reducing costs out of operations; a cost-conscious ethos becomes quite ingrained. Challenging the 100% solution to find the best "bang for the buck" is part of my role and what I do on an allmost daily basis. 

It was with this mindset I approached the challenge to study an MBA that would also work with my family and travel constraints.
Online degree programmes have been around for years, and distance learning as a whole is much older. So with the increase in online course popularity/availability; I decided to look into the feasibility of being able to blend together an online MBA developed entirely out of MOOCs from some of the worlds top business programmes. 

After doing some research into the curriculum of some reputable university’s (Harvard / Berkeley / Wharton / Stanford etc) I have come to the following list of course content that needs to be covered as the “core curriculum”

* Accounting
* Business Strategy
* Economics
* Finance
* Marketing
* Leadership
* Operations
* Statistics / Data Analysis
* Ethics
* Entrepreneurship

Most information I found had suggested somewhere between 8-12 hours per week per subject is required to complete the courses. As a father of two and quite a demanding job, I had decided to look at this as a long-term goal and take one subject at a time. 

I have a reasonable distance to travel to work so generally allocated one hour per work day to study during transit on my tablet. All in all, it was a 2.5 year effort; but the flexibility this way of working gave really allowed me to manage it well within my schedule. The quality of the courses was phenomenal and I would highly recommend to all. If you have any questions or would like to know more from my experience on the topic, please drop me a line.

## Leadership
![Bocconi](/images/mba/bocconi.jpg){: style="float:right"}
**International Leadership and Organizational Behavior (Bocconi University)**

Leaders in business and non-profit organizations increasingly work across national boarders and in multi-cultural environments. You may work regularly with customers or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team, or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context.

**About The Course**

In this course – together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi alumni – we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.

This course will be broken up into 6 modules covering the following topics:

* Leadership Acumen
* Navigating Culture
* Communication
* Motivation
* Networking
* Conflict

Remember the last time you went to a restaurant. What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and didn’t want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctor’s office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didn’t want to pay too much for it. Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity, increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards.
